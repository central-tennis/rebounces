		<description><![CDATA[One of Ibis Country Club&#039;s biggest challenges is being &quot;cost effective&quot; while keeping the quality of the teaching balls at a high level. ReBounces has effectively solved the problem! Our members have noticed the difference in the bounce, and we have cut the cost of practice balls in half while providing a better quality ball.....this machine is like &quot;fountain of youth&quot; for practice balls!

		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to send you a quick note saying how pleased we are with the Rebouncer that we bought from you 18 months ago.  We’ve been able to get three and four lives out of our dead tennis balls and we’ve saved countless dollars on practice balls thanks to the Rebouncer.  It’s a great idea recycling tennis balls and we are looking forward to many years of continued savings.  Thanks again.

		<description><![CDATA[We love the concept of recycling and the PR aspect of being a green club that&#039;s trying to contribute to helping the environment. We have a lot of members who appreciate the effort and think it s very creative that we are participating. The Green Tennis Machine will cut down on our ball purchases up to 50% and they work just as well as the fresh balls out of the can. I would definitely recommend the Green Tennis Machine. It is working very well for East Bank Club.

		<description><![CDATA[Northwood Club is proud to be a part of the growing number of clubs that are going green. Our Green Tennis Machine allows us to have fresh tennis balls in each of our six pro’s teaching carts and both of our ball machines on a constant and ongoing basis at a much lower cost. We expect that the money we save from not buying as many new teaching balls will allow us to pay for the machine within the first year. The environment is happy, the pros are happy, the members are happy, and the club is happy. It’s a beautiful thing.

		<description><![CDATA[Eric we have really enjoyed our “Mean Green Tennis Machine”. Our ability to enhance our members’ tennis experience either during lessons or using the ball machine has been aided due to the fact that we can eliminate the dead ball problem all clubs face. Also, it doesn’t hurt our reputation that we are a ‘green’ club. Today’s climate demands we be aware of our environment and the consequences of our actions or lack thereof.

		<description><![CDATA[We are thrilled with the Green Machine results! It is very simple to use and the savings are amazing, you can fit about 500 balls per load and they will last about 3 weeks. If you are a Tennis Pro you know how much you spend every month on tennis balls. It is the best investment any tennis club can make!

		<description><![CDATA[We are more than excited with the Green Tennis Machine. This is an amazing innovation for college coaches and can extend their budgets as well as provide players with &quot;new&quot; balls every day that force them to prepare early for shots and develop more offensive firepower. The Green Tennis Machine has been great for us. We are quicker to the ball than before because there are never any slightly dead balls in our hoppers. Our guys have really noticed a difference. We have &quot;re-energized&quot; over 1200 formerly dead balls in just a few weeks.
