		<description><![CDATA[Using the Green Machine has been a great addition to our club and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ferrisstatebulldogs.com/sports/mten/index&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tennis teams&lt;/a&gt;.  We are able to keep our tennis balls ‘as good as new’ which allows us to use quality tennis balls for our tennis programming and college practices. It truly has revolutionized tennis balls and has been able to keep our costs down from having to always purchase new balls.  Great product!

		<description><![CDATA[For me it&#039;s been great. I always know that I&#039;m going to have good balls coming through. It&#039;s just been something that&#039;s been really successful for us. We have eliminated approximately 75% of the balls we used to purchase for our camps each year.

		<description><![CDATA[The Green Tennis Machine we purchased a year ago has been great!! We use it for both lessons and the ball throwing machine, which previously was a challenge to stock good bouncing balls. Prior to purchasing  the Green Machine we had 3 practice ball orders and now we have 1 -- we eliminated 2 of the orders. I would highly recommend the Green Tennis Machine.

		<description><![CDATA[The Green Tennis Machine has been great. Our ball budget has decreased immensely. We have been able to utilize the Green Tennis Machine very effectively in the teaching program. It doesn’t take very long to basically cook up the balls and get them back in the system within 3 or 4 days. So, it has been a great help and a great benefit for the overall operation -- regular regulation yellow official tennis balls as well as regular quick start, red, green and orange balls.

		<description><![CDATA[The machine has been fantastic up to this point.  I have had no problems and it has been great!  I have cycled the balls through a couple of times now and was happy with the results.  Very happy.

Thank you.

		<description><![CDATA[Our club has been using the Green Tennis Machine for close to a year. The machine works great. I took the advice from Eric Korita and put out a recycle bin to collect used balls from our members. Our members have been supplying us with our balls ever since. We have not needed to purchase any new balls (big savings) since we got the machine and our members love we are recycling used balls. The only thing better than their product is their great customer service. -  Jim Klein / Director of Tennis / Doylestown Tennis Club]]></description>
