		<description><![CDATA[“The Green Tennis Machine has been great for us.  Maintaining consistent practice balls is a huge plus for our student athletes and a big help with our summer camps.  We have balls cooking around the clock now which equates to significant savings.  I would recommend the GTM to anyone serious about their practice balls.”

		<description><![CDATA[The Green Tennis Machine has already paid for itself by allowing us to cancel over half of our ball order for the year.  It has also become an additional revenue source, allowing us to sell repressurized balls and rent out the use of the machine to other programs and tennis professionals.  It has been great for our bottom line and it is great for the environment!  This machine is a game changer for the tennis industry.

		<description><![CDATA[The Green Tennis Machine is the most significant product to hit the tennis world in years. As academy owners we see the substantial financial commitment we make to keep quality tennis balls in our teaching carts. The Green Tennis Machine ensures that every ball we feed bounces, and the savings we gain from having multiple cycles with our balls has been tremendous. It is good for the sport and good for the planet, and that&#039;s a winning combination!
