<p>We ship these units anywhere in the world.</p>
<h2>What Tennis Balls Can I Repressurize in a 60 Ball Green Machine?</h2>
<p>Utilizing our revolutionary reBounces technology, you can now restore dead balls back to their original bounce. The Green Tennis Machine extends the life of your practice balls and reduces waste that goes to landfills. On average our commercial clients save over 50% on their practice ball budgets and are finding that they can cut back on purchasing enough new tennis balls to more than pay for their Green Tennis Machines. And with our various financing options, they are not having to make a capital investment.</p>
<p>From traditional brands like Wilson, Head, Penn, or Dunlop to padel balls (common in Spain). We find that the better quality balls (typically higher price = higher quality) the better the results of the ball coming out of the Green Tennis Machine. Makes sense right? We’re not fixing the rubber or felt quality, but just putting the bounce back in the old ball.   We even have formulas for youth “red, orange and green” balls.</p>
